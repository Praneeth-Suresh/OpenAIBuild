# Ubiquitous Language

| Business Term | Technical Symbol | Definition | Constraints | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Design Concept | `DesignConcept` | The shared organizing model guiding architecture and implementation choices. | Must be coherent across contexts. | `Idea`, `GeneralModel` |
| Design Tree | `DesignTree` | Living map of open and settled decisions. | Updated when design moves. | `PlanDump` |
| Bounded Context | `BoundedContext` | A domain boundary with explicit ownership and language. | Owns its internal model and API. | `Module` (too generic) |
| Ubiquitous Language | `UbiquitousLanguage` | Shared domain vocabulary in docs and code. | Terms must be stable and explicit. | Ambiguous nouns like `Data` |
| Feedback Loop | `FeedbackLoop` | Generate-check-fix cycle using deterministic tools. | Must include real tool output. | `TryAgainLoop` |
| Entropy Hotspot | `EntropyHotspot` | High-churn and high-complexity area likely to degrade maintainability. | Used for targeted refactoring. | `MessyFile` |
| Vertical Slice | `VerticalSlice` | Smallest end-to-end behavior change through one boundary. | Must be testable in isolation. | `BigRefactor` |
| Adapter | `Adapter` | Boundary object that isolates external systems from domain logic. | Domain must not depend on vendor details. | `ServiceHelper` |
| Seam | `Seam` | Intentional change point for behavior substitution without invasive edits. | Should be protected by tests. | `HackPoint` |
| ADR | `ADR` | Architecture Decision Record for durable decisions. | Required for lasting boundary changes. | `RandomNote` |
